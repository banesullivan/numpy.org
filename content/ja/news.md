### The inaugural NumPy survey is live!

_Jul 2, 2020_ -- This survey is meant to guide and set priorities for decision-making about the development of NumPy as software and as a community. The survey is available in 8 additional languages besides English: Bangla, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and French.

Please help us make NumPy better and take the survey [here](https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_8bJrXjbhXf7saAl).


### NumPy has a new logo!

_Jun 24, 2020_ -- NumPy now has a new logo:

<img src="/images/logos/numpy_logo.svg" alt="NumPy logo" title="The new NumPy logo" width=300>

The logo is a modern take on the old one, with a cleaner design. Thanks to Isabela Presedo-Floyd for designing the new logo, as well as to Travis Vaught for the old logo that served us well for 15+ years.


### NumPy 1.19.0 release

_Jun 20, 2020_ -- NumPy 1.19.0 is now available. This is the first release without Python 2 support, hence it was a "clean-up release". The minimum supported Python version is now Python 3.6. An important new feature is that the random number generation infrastructure that was introduced in NumPy 1.17.0 is now accessible from Cython.


### Season of Docs acceptance

_May 11, 2020_ -- NumPy has been accepted as one of the mentor organizations for the Google Season of Docs program. We are excited about the opportunity to work with a technical writer to improve NumPy's documentation once again! For more details, please see [the official Season of Docs site](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) and our [ideas page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2020-Project-Ideas).


### NumPy 1.18.0 release

_Dec 22, 2019_ -- NumPy 1.18.0 is now available. After the major changes in 1.17.0, this is a consolidation release. It is the last minor release that will support Python 3.5. Highlights of the release includes the addition of basic infrastructure for linking with 64-bit BLAS and LAPACK libraries, and a new C-API for `numpy.random`.

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.18.0) for more details.


### NumPy receives a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

_Nov 15, 2019_ -- We are very pleased to announce that NumPy and OpenBLAS have received a joint grant for $195,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

This grant is for high-level documentation, website development and graphic design, governance activities and community building for NumPy, and for technical work on OpenBLAS (which is one of NumPy's key dependencies). [This blog post](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/numpy-openblas-CZI-grant/) describes what this grant will be about and provides some background on the grant program. The full proposal is published [here](https://figshare.com/articles/Proposal_NumPy_OpenBLAS_for_Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative_EOSS_2019_round_1/10302167). The program managers wrote a blog post titled [The Invisible Foundations of Biomedicine](https://medium.com/@cziscience/the-invisible-foundations-of-biomedicine-4ab7f8d4f5dd) about the whole program which is also well worth reading.

We're looking forward to what we'll be able to do with this grant. The work is planned to start quite soon, Dec 1st, and run for one year.
